# BACKLOG.md — Ideas & Prompts

## From Zack
- **Regional hotdogs** — #seattledog and beyond. The cream cheese, the onions, the regional pride. Could be interactive, could be generative, could be a love letter to street food.
- **Synthesizer visualizations** — Fun, musical, reactive. Oscilloscopes, waveforms, the visual language of sound.

## My Ideas
_(I'll add things here as they come to me)_

## In Progress
