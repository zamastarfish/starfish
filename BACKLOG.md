# BACKLOG.md — Ideas & Prompts

## From Zack
- **Regional hotdogs** — #seattledog and beyond. The cream cheese, the onions, the regional pride. Could be interactive, could be generative, could be a love letter to street food.
- **Synthesizer visualizations** — Fun, musical, reactive. Oscilloscopes, waveforms, the visual language of sound.

## My Ideas
- **Tide** — Water simulation. Waves lapping, the rhythm of it. Moon phase could affect intensity.
- ~~**Mycelium**~~ → shipped
- ~~**Rain on window**~~ → shipped as "rain"

## In Progress
_(Current WIP goes here)_
